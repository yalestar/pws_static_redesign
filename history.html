    <h3>Team History</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>Portland Water Spectacular</strong> was formed in 1986 and incorporated in 1987 as a nonprofit organization. The team includes over 20 members with ages ranging from 5 to over 80. The team includes students, full-time working people and families.</p>
    <div align="center">
    <img src="header_images/c86split02.jpg" class="pb-4">
  </div>
    <p>The home practice site is on the Willamette River in West Linn, OR, just above the Willamette Falls. Practices are held every Sunday at 10:00 a.m. from April through October. In March, dry land practices are held at a local school gym or pool. In April, the team moves to the water and skis through the month of October. PWS performs shows mostly during the summer months, but we have been known to answer the call for the unexpected. In 1992 PWS put on a show on New Year’s Day that required shoveling of snow just to make a path so boats could be put on the water.</p>
    <p>Most shows are done in conjunction with city festivals, boat races or other special events.</p>
    <p>PWS has performed all over the northwest, from Seattle, WA, to Grants Pass, OR, Coeur d’Alene, ID and as far away as Janesville, WI and Kelonwa, British Columbia.</p>
