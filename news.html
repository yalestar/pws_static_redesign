    <td width="33%" valign="TOP" height="112"><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Remember the
    commercial that asked people what they would do for a Klondike bar? </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">They'd do just about anything----squawk like chickens, act like
    chimpanzees and wear Groucho Marx glasses.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Jaclyn LeDoux, 15, was in a similar situation. She had to do something
    pretty embarrassing for someone her age to get what she wanted--and it wasn't an ice cream
    bar.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The Portland Water Spectacular ski team member wore a &quot;really
    goofy&quot; paper hat at least 30 times in front of almost 100,000 fans at Portland, Ore.,
    Trailblazers basketball games. There, she earned enough money to cover cost of competing
    Saturday in the 1997 Water Show Ski Nationals on the Rock River in Janesville.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">More than 40 teammates of all ages wore the hats, frequently donned by
    burger-flippers, while working at concession stands at, the games. Most people probably
    wouldn't make a big deal out of it. But if you remember anything about being a teenagers
    you'll remember that practically everything is embarrassing.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">LeDoux looks back on the experience with humor. Anything that gets her
    closer to her dream--a college water skiing scholarship is worth it, she said. </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The Portland Water Spectacular, which will compete for a national title
    for the first time, has come a long way, both geographically and otherwise. </font></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="TOP" height="112"><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">The team came
    up with the $20,000 it needed to cover traveling and competition expenses for nationals.
    It's president made arrangements to borrow boats from Wisconsin ski clubs because
    they-could not bring their own this far.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Of<b> </b>the 60-member team, 42 will compete Saturday. The rest of the
    team either couldn't get away from work or couldn't foot the trip's expenses, because
    concession stand profits covered only 80 percent of the cost. Each member had to chip in
    the remaining 20 percent, said Robyn Hanson, the Western Regional National Show Ski
    Association representative. The team also does not<b> </b>have a home site, said Hanson, a
    former Portland skier. The skiers must take a boat out to a dock in the middle of the
    river for practices.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;We're stuck there,&quot; she said. &quot;There's no bathrooms.
    There's nothing.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">All of the team's shows are on the road. Members must haul their own
    skis, boats, ramps and costumes with them, so the farthest from Oregon they've performed
    is Idaho. Most of their shows are in Washington and Oregon, Hanson said.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Team members traveled with their costumes, ropes and skis. Mad-city Ski
    Team of Madison loaned the team a twin-rig outboard to pull their big acts, such as the
    difficult four tier pyramid. Beaverland Must-Skis of Beaver Dam loaned the team a
    Single-engine outboard;</font></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="TOP" height="112"><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">the Rock Aqua
    Jays supplied a pickup boat for skiers who fall, and the Lake Sinnissippi Water Ski Team,
    Hustisford, contributed another boat. Rockford's Ski Broncs loaned some skis. </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The youngest team member, 10-year-old Carol Dumolt, makes the fourth
    tier of the four-high pyramid<b>.&nbsp; </b>The oldest team member is 55. One-fourth of
    the team is under age 18<b>.</p>
    </b><p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;A lot of times, we practice Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
    do a show for the weekend, come back Sunday night, and all we have off is Monday.&quot;
    Hanson said.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Portland traveled the farthest of any team to participate in nationals.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;It was such an effort to come this year we probably couldn't come
    up with enough money again for at least two years,&quot; show director Doug Kaaretinen
    said.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Team members said they wouldn't be here if it weren't for the kindness
    of the Rock Aqua Jays and other teams who loaned equipment</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Badgerland and the Rock Aqua Jays have been like big brother
    teams to us because they've sent people to ski camps and worked with us, given us ideas
    and really helped us out,&quot; Kaaretinen said. &quot;Knowing they're watching us, we
    want to show them what they taught us, we're using.&quot;</font></td>
