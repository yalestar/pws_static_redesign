    Ballard, an intrepid waterskier, is willing to risk January chills to celebrate the New
    Year.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">On Thursday, she led four teen-age
    girls as they stretched their legs on the concrete dock below Riverplace Marina on the
    Willamette River.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">Then the five, members of a team
    called Portland Water Spectacular, took to the water to carry on a 12-year New Year&#146;s
    Day tradition.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">They skied at noon from the marina,
    making a loop between the Ross Island and Hawthorne bridges.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">Portland Water Spectacular is the
    largest team of stunt-performing water-skiers in the Northwest, said Ballard, 32, of
    Oregon City, who organized Thursday&#146;s exhibition, She has skied on New Years Day for
    11 of the past 12 years.</font></tt></p>

    their feet from the cold, </font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">choppy water &#150; to nine men and
    women who preformed a three-tier pyramid.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">The temperature was 43 degrees, both
    in and out of the water. But the experienced team members weren&#146;t fazed. Beneath her
    outer layer, Ballard wore two pairs of pants and several shirts.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The water is warmer than
    usual,&quot; said Scott Van Dusen, 34 a skier from Lake Oswego. &quot;Usually it&#146;s
    somewhere in the 30s.&quot;But Jaci Emery, 13, who was skiing her first New Years day, was
    surprised by the cold. After leaving the river, she submerged her legs is a large plastic
    bucket of warm water. Then she was ready for another run. Like her </font></tt></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="TOP"><p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">teammates,
    she uses only one ski, a type designed for stunts with a foot hold that swivels 360
    degrees. She received the stunt ski as a Christmas present last week.Few spectators braved
    the drizzle and cold southern wind to watch the exhibition. Onlookers included four
    mallard ducks and two Canadian geese.</font></tt></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><tt><font face="Times New Roman">Between April and September, the team
    practices four nights a week for exhibitions and competitions. The 32 team members, 12 of
    whom participated Thursday, <a href="news.html">traveled to Wisconsin</a> to their first
    national competition last year. Beginning in February, they practice weight-training and
    gymnastics indoors in preparation for the spring season. Members&#146; ages range from 4
    to 55.&quot;We love this sport,&quot; Van Dusen said. &quot;We mostly get together today
    because we haven&#146;t skied in a couple of months. But it&#146;s more fun in the warm
    weather</font></tt></td>
